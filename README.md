# Spelling-Checker
This project implements a simple spelling checker application built with Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Features:

Checks spelling of entered text against a built-in dictionary.
Highlights misspelled words in the text entry area.
Provides suggestions for correcting misspelled words (optional).
Requirements:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Tkinter (included in most Python installations)
Installation:

Clone this repository or download the project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the application using the following command:
python main.py


Usage:

Type text into the entry area.
Click the "Check Spelling" button.
Misspelled words will be highlighted in red.
(Optional) The application may display a list of suggested corrections for misspelled words (depending on implementation).
Built-in Dictionary:

The application uses a built-in Python dictionary for spell checking. You can customize the dictionary by replacing the provided one with a more comprehensive source (not included).

Future Improvements:

Integrate a more extensive dictionary or utilize online spell checking APIs.
Implement suggestion functionality for misspelled words.
Enhance the GUI with additional features like case sensitivity options.
